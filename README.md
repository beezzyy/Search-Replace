# Search & Replaceüîç

This program is a simple search and 
replace application. Specifically, it finds a user-specified text string within a group 
of disk files, modify those strings and update the original disk files, and then provides a 
report that indicates what has been done.




## Demo

Add some .txt files or folders with .txt files in them into the directory with the program and run the following command in your terminal

`gcc replace.c text.c traversal.c report.c`

This should compile the program and generate a file named a.out.

Then, type the following command in the terminal: ./a.out <argument>.
For example, `./a.out hello`.
